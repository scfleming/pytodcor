This set of tests is for the two-dimensional cross-correlation applied to simple datasets and model templates, e.g., symmetric Gaussians with no noise.

Case Parameters:
- Is Observed X-Axis Identical To Templates' X-Axis? (same\_x = True)
- Is There No Shift Between Observed Feature and Template Feature? (no\_temp\_shift = True)
- Is There No Difference In Shape Of Observed Feature Height Compared To Template? (same\_height = True)
- Is There No Difference in Shape Of Observed Feature Width Compared To Template? (same\_width = True)
- Is The Scaling Ratio Between Model Templates Fixed? (fixed\_alpha = True)

Case 1: same\_x = True, no\_temp\_shift = True, same\_height = True, same\_width = True, fixed\_alpha=True

Case 2: same\_x = False, no\_temp\_shift = True, same\_height = True, same\_width = True, fixed\_alpha=True
